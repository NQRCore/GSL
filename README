=head2 Building from source

GSL requires Parrot (see http://www.parrot.org).  If you can
build Parrot, you should be fine building GSL (which currently
uses Parrot 3.3.0 as of July 10, 2011).

To obtain GSL directly from its repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/NQRCore/GSL.git

Once you have a copy of GSL, build and test it as follows:

    $ ./configure.pl
    $ parrot setup.pir
    $ parrot setup.pir test

I don't expect anyone will use this directly, but will rather
link the functionality into their own projects via the native
call interface (NCI) of Parrot.
