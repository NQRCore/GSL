Started a configure process; however, it appears that a
root-permission make install will be needed, so hold off
for now, will probably need to change.

Tried to do a simple call to a function in libgsl in the
way that worked in NQR.  Ran into thunk trouble.  Comments
provided in src/GSL/SCRATCH from plobsing and bubaflub, some
stuff I really need to look at before going much further.

Tried a simpler function call: SUCCESS!  So it really is that
'thunk' problem.  Progress.  Next up:
