Today I will be studying bubaflub's GMP project in greater detail.
It might be smart to merge my signature information from yesterday
with his framework, rather than re-inventing the wheel.  Use my
signature information to get the nci file, then use the script
to get the pir bindings.  Then build the infrastructure following
the GMP example.

Started building a perl script to generate signatures from the
output of nm and using the header files.  This would let me
either write code or perhaps make use of ncidef2pir.

Started a configure process; however, it appears that a
root-permission make install will be needed, so hold off
for now, will probably need to change.

Tried to do a simple call to a function in libgsl in the
way that worked in NQR.  Ran into thunk trouble.  Comments
provided in src/GSL/SCRATCH from plobsing and bubaflub, some
stuff I really need to look at before going much further.

Tried a simpler function call: SUCCESS!  So it really is that
'thunk' problem.  Progress.  Next up:
